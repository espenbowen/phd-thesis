\subsection{Summary}

This thesis presents measurements of the differential branching fraction and angular moments of the decay $\decay{\B^0}{K^{+}\pi^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}$ in the $K^{+}\pi^{-}$ invariant mass range \mbox{$1330<m(\Kp\pim)<1530~\mathrm{\,Me\kern -0.1em V\!/}c^{2}$}.  The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3$\ensuremath{\mbox{\,fb}^{-1}}\xspace$ of $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment.  The differential branching fraction is reported in five narrow \qsq bins between 0.1 and 8.0\gevgevcccc and in the range $1.1<\qsq<6.0\gevgevcccc$, where an angular moments analysis is also performed.

The measured values of the angular observables $\overline{\Gamma}_{2}$ and $\overline{\Gamma}_{3}$ point towards the presence of large interference effects between the S- and P- or D-wave contributions. Using only $\overline{\Gamma}_{5}$ and $\overline{\Gamma}_{10}$ it is possible to estimate the D-wave fraction, $F_{\rm D}$,  yielding an upper limit of $F_{\rm D}<0.29$ at 95\% confidence level. This value is lower than naively expected from amplitude analyses of \BdToJPsiKpi decays~\cite{belle-z-paper}.

The underlying Wilson coefficients may be extracted from the normalised moments and covariance matrix presented in this analysis, when combined with a prediction for the form factors. While first estimates for the form factors are given in Ref.~\cite{lu-wang}, no interpretation of the results in terms of the Wilson coefficients is made at this time. With additional input from theory, these results could provide further contributions to understanding the pattern of deviations with respect to SM predictions that has been observed in other \btosmm transitions.
